Actually the first gem version is published, you can install it by following the official [doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/). You can find the rubygem version [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/leonids). But it will be on beta until I can finish the doc of how you can install leonids with the rubygem version.",
